## Project Summary

#### Title: SplitData


#### Summary: 
Our project SplitData is an app that personalizes your workout schedule based on your goals and abilities. It will create workout plans that fit your schedule, prioritize your preferred muscle groups, and build your desired athletic skill sets, all while making sure that you are not neglecting any areas in your training.

#### Usefulness:
Many of us experience a plateau in our fitness journey, often due to repetitive routines and uncertainty about how to challenge ourselves effectively. Our app aims to elevate the workouts of recreational gym-goers by providing personalized training plans that adapt to each user's progress. By setting tailored goals and benchmarks, the app encourages users to continually push their limits and enhance their performance. With insights and recommendations that evolve alongside their fitness journey, users can break through barriers, discover new strengths, and achieve their desired results with confidence.
